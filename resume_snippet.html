               GlobalGiving is an online market for ideas, information, and money that democratizes aid and philanthropy in support of several thousand grassroots non-profits around the world. Since joining the organization as a <a href=http://www.proinspire.org>ProInspire Fellow</a>, I focus on using our data to answer critical strategy questions, building new data-driven tools to help make our data more digestible and accessible, and inventing new techniques for tracking our social impact. Some of the accomplishments I'm most proud of include designing and implementing an enterprise-level self-serve reporting solution to share insights from our databases with everyone on staff, creating an algorithm that has stopped over $250,000 in fraud by premptively detecting when illegitimate donations are made on the site, and fostering a culture of experimentation by advising colleagues on experimental design and statistical analysis.

               <p>
               My work at PTC centered around configuring tools and systems for engineering firms large and small to better collect, measure, and analyze data around the reliability of their products.  These implementations varied as widely as our customers, from a way to track armored vehicle maintenance and inventory across three continents simultaneously to a system for managing the reliability at each step of the supply chain of one of the largest celluar device manufacturers in the world to a process and tool to record and understand 100,000+ points of field failure data for anti-aircraft defense units. In addition, I designed and delivered several custom training courses on a wide range of reliability topics and redesigned our internal business process for developing statements of work to improve scoping accuracy, increase customer satisfaction, and manage $50K-$100K services jobs.
